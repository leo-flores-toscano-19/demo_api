### Date
July 2, 2020

### Location of deployed application
If applicable, please provide the url where we can find and interact with your running application.

### Time spent
5-6 hrs core of the app
2-3 hrs on a failed attempt to implement the login with github and add the specs with rspec

### Assumptions made
Just followed the instructions of your document as close as I could.

### Shortcuts/Compromises made
If applicable. Did you do something that you feel could have been done better in a real-world application? Yes TDD. I got stuck with the omnitocken trying to implement the github login then I started but as It was taken time and I have to do your test and one for other company I adjusted time.

### Stretch goals attempted
If applicable, use this area to tell us what stretch goals you attempted. What went well? What do you wish you
could have done better? 

I did not attempt basic login as I saw your note regarding curl. I had that running so I only pursue the social app login. I tried but could not resolve the issue and I felt I spent to much time on it.

I am honest I have this app working and I need to work in different take home test. I just went for the publication of the app in a prod "like environment"
